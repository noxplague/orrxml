    	<title>OneNote for iOS 2.2.1 - iPhone update</title>
    	<description>Three updates:
			First, It makes OneNote for iPhone a standalone experience with the ability to create new notebooks and sections. This means that you can now create a notebook, share it with others, and get on the same page - all from the convenience of an iPhone. 
			Second, It dramatically improves the look and feel of OneNote on iOS 7 making note taking and navigation of your notes much more fluid and efficient.
			Third, we've added Office Lens to OneNote for iPhone. Similar to Office Lens on OneNote for iPad, this popular feature turns your iPhone into a pocket scanner so you can use it to take pictures of things like receipts, or whiteboard notes. Then, with Office Lens you can trim, enhance and makes pictures more readable. Best thing is, images are automatically synced to OneNote, and if your picture includes printed text, OneNote can recognize the text with optical character recognition (OCR) so you can search for words in the image.</description>
